This repo contains most of the code I have written for solving problems in the Functional Programming track at HackerRank. All the solutions presented here were written in Scala, and I have tried my best to be as elegant and concise as possible. This does not mean that all the solutions followed the most pure functional paradigms, but I do think that readibility and simplicity are just as important as the lack of side effects and purely functional constructs. Since Scala is a multiparadigm language, I do think that the code that one writes is the 'right' one when the correct balance is found between the functional way of thinking and the usage of mutable data structures. I hope you will enjoy solving these problems by using various functional languages (purely or not), just as I did. Have Fun!
